    <h2>A Town Called Desire</h2>
    <h3>Reborn In Tandem</h3>
    <p>A town caught in the crossfires during the Fourth Corporate War. 
Bullets lodged into buildings and bodies of intended or unintended participants of the clash between the two mega corporations. After a short time when the fighting was done you went back to see the havoc left, in only a weekend’s worth time the place was wrecked as if they fought for two years there. </p>
<p>
Bullets scattered like seashells, more of the people who died there lived here, and roads shattered and scrawled.

    The town’s governing body was unaccounted for either dead or have left, with some of the surviving people of the town. After the bodies were buried,
