    <h2>A Town Called Desire</h2>
    <h3>Reborn In Tandem</h3>
    <p>A town caught in the crossfires during the Fourth Corporate War. 
Bullets lodged into buildings and bodies of intended or unintended participants of the clash between the two mega corporations. After a short time when the fighting was done you went back to see the havoc left, in only a weekend’s worth time the place was wrecked as if they fought for two years.</p>
<p>
Bullets scattered like seashells, more of the people who died there lived here, and roads shattered and scrawled.

<p>
    Arasaka isn't interested in compensating since they lost where you now stood, Militech could pay up but you're town would be down that list of reconstructing and recompensating. It could be years or even decades before they reach and even then you'd have to fight for the right amount of not only what you lost but those around you.
    After the bodies buried, some moved away to greener pastures or towards the ranchlands of the corporations who invaded the town. 

    The town’s governing body was unaccounted for either dead or have left, with some of the surviving people of the town. You couldn't abandon this place, the constant cycle of corporate conflicts, this place wouldn't be the last. <p>This place not only needs to be rebuilt but a redirection</p>
</p>
<p>In Your Direction.</p>
